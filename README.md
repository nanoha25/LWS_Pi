# SSH
Signals Software Health project repository
This repository is for Signals Software Health project. 

The inital project is Dynamic Body Fat Monitor. It is abandoned due to significant difficulties encountered. 
One fallback project is weather station. The other one is accelerometer on iPhone for falling detection. Both projects continues concurrently. 

Update: Now SSH project is terminated, this repo is changed into the further development of local weather station. Settings and links will remain unchanged for marking purposes however, as the final mark is not out yet.
